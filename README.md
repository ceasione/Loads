# Inter Smart Group Loads tracking API

## Overview

The Intersmart Tracking API is a specialized fork of the original Intersmartgroup API, focused exclusively on car and freight tracking. It is designed for logistics operations that require real-time monitoring of transportation assets without additional cost calculation features.

This API is written in Python using Flask, with a strong emphasis on a powerful Telegram bot interface for managing fleets and tracking assets.

## Features

- **Real-Time Car & Freight Tracking**:
  - Track active shipments and vehicle in real-time.
  - View detailed data for each tracked vehicle.
  - Manage and update fleet data (CRUD operations) entirely through the Telegram bot.

- **Advanced Telegram Bot Functionality**:
  - Provides an interactive command interface for admins.
  - Allows real-time updates within the bot.
  - Supports inline queries and callback buttons for enhanced UX.

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Built with **Flask (Python)**.
- **Data Handling**: Uses lightweight file-based storageâ€”no SQL database.
- **Telegram Bot**: Central to system functionality, using **python-telegram-bot** library.
- **Deployment**: Runs in production using **uWSGI**, with security best practices applied.
